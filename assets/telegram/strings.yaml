        Lets set your GitHub API key\. I can only hold one at a time and I will use it to get information about your projects\.

        You can create a key on [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)\. *Make sure*:

        • *You are the owner* of the account that you are adding the key for\.
        • Only you and me \(this bot\) know the key because *its like a password*\.
        • The key's permissions are _read:project_ and *that is it*\.

        Once you have generated the key, send it here as a message\.
        Be aware that once you close the key creation page you can no longer see it\. You yourself dont need to keep any copies, but if you fail to paste it in you'll have to delete the old one and generate a new one\.

        If what you've sent me just now is a GitHub API token, *immediately* [revoke it](https://github.com/settings/tokens)\!
        You should never try to add tokens in a public chat.

    cancel: ["Canceled."]
    success: ['Nice to meet you, <a href="https://github.com/%%s">%%s</a>!']
