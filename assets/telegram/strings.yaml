        Hi! %s

        You can use /help to get a list of commands. To get started send me /addApiKey in private messages.

    help:

        %s
        Here are the commands I have:

        <b><u>Groups and Private messages</u></b>
        • /help: you are here!
        • /dailyStatus: Generate a report from your GitHub project
            • /dailyStatus <code>date</code> <code>&lt;DATE&gt;</code>: Set a specific day instead of the default (today). The generated report will have the date in italics.
        • /setDefaultProject: If you have multiple projects you can set a default one for this chat. If you only have 1, then it is automatically the default.
            • /setDefaultProject <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>: The ID can be specified in the command itself.

        <b><u>Private messages</u></b>
        • /addApiKey: Set/delete your GitHub API key
        • /listProjects: List your projects (if the API key is set)
            • /listProjects <code>after</code> <code>&lt;CURSOR&gt;</code>: Used to show the next page

        <i>Note:</i> <code>&lt;CURSOR&gt;</code> is a short (2+ characters) string used for pagination.
        <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> is a long string and all project IDs start with <code>PVT_</code>.

    addApiKey:
      - |
        You can create a key on <a href="%s">this page</a>.
        • Click Generate token in the top right corner
        • Select Classic token
        • Give your token a name
        • Set the permissions to read:project
        • Click Generate token
        • Copy the token and send it here as a message.

        <b>Please only do these things:</b>
        • Only give me tokens for accounts you own.
        • Keep the token itself a secret before and after you send it to me because its like a password to view your projects and some details of your account.
        • The key's permissions are <b>read:project</b> and <b>that is it</b>. I wont need any more permissions so dont give them to me!

        /cancel quits this menu
        /none deletes the currently saved key

    dailyStatus:
      - |
        I will generate a report for <b><u>%%s</u></b>. First I need to know what's your discovery of the day?

        /none: Omit "Discovery of the day" from the report.
        /cancel: Cancel <code>/dailyStatus</code>

    setDefaultProject:
      - |
        Please send me a project ID. You can find it under a project's title in /listProjects. It looks something like this:

        Mg Project title (octocat/1)
        <u><b>ID: PVT_...</b></u>

        /none: Delete the currently saved default project
        /cancel: Quit this menu


    savedDefaultProject: &root_savedDefaultProject ["Saved %%q as the default project"]

    useSetDefaultProject: &root_useSetDefaultProject ["You have too many projects. Use /setDefaultProject to define a default for this chat."]

    lastProjectsPage: ["No more pages"]

    privateCommandUsed: ["This command only works in private (direct) messages for your privacy and security."]

    unknownMessage: ["Sorry, I don't understand. Try /help maybe?"]

    noApiKeyAdded: &root_noApiKeyAdded ["You have not added a GitHub API key, so I can't see your projects. Please use /addApiKey"]

    userHasZeroProjects:
      - |
        You seem to have 0 projects in your profile (and yes your API key works)!
        Either that or your API key doesnt have read:project permissions.

        Try adding a project or readding your API key using /addApiKey.

    githubErrorGeneric: &root_githubErrorGeneric ["Something went wrong while contacting GitHub. Is your API key still valid?"]

  addApiKey:
    success:
      - |
        Nice to meet you, <a href="https://github.com/%%s">%%s</a>!
        You probably want to use /help to see a command list.

    cancel: ["Canceled."]

    deleted: ["Key deleted."]

    badApiKey: ["Could not use your token, try again or /cancel"]

    keySentInPublicChat:
      - |
        If what you've sent me just now is a GitHub API token, <b>immediately</b> <a href="%s">revoke it</a>!
        You should never try to add tokens in a public chat.
