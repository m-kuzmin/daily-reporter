        Hi! %s

        You can use /help to get a list of commands. To get started send me /addApiKey in private messages.

    help:
      - |
        %s
        Here are the commands I have:

        • /help: you are here!
        <b>Private messages:</b>
        • /addApiKey: Set/delete your GitHub API key
        • /listProjects: List your projects (if the API key is set)
            • /listProjects after ID: Used to show the next page

        In general all multistep commands have /none to delete/unset/skip assignment and /cancel to exit without changes.
        Here's an example:
        • /addApiKey → /cancel — Has no effect
        • /addApiKey → /none — Deletes the key

      - botDescription

    addApiKey:
      - |
        You can create a key on <a href="%s">this page</a>. <b>Make sure</b>:
        • <b>You are the owner</b> of the account that you are adding the key for.
        • Only you and me (this bot) know the key because <b>its like a password</b>.
        • The key's permissions are <b>read:project</b> and <b>that is it</b>.
        <i>Be aware that once you close the key creation page you can no longer see it.</i>

        Once you have generated the key, send it here as a message.
        /cancel quits this menu
        /none deletes the currently saved key

        I will generate a report for %%s. First I need to know what's your discovery of the day?

        /none: Omit "Questions/Blockers" from the report.

    dailyStatusOneProject:

        I can only see one project: <code>%%s</code> <a href=%%q>%%s</a>.
        Do you want me to use it as default?

        /cancel: Cancel <code>/dailyStatus</code>

    userHasZeroProjects:

        You seem to have 0 projects in your profile!
        Either that or your API key doesnt have read:project permissions.

        If what you've sent me just now is a GitHub API token, <b>immediately</b> <a href="%s">revoke it</a>!
        You should never try to add tokens in a public chat.
